Base of my personal ZSH environment.

## Install ##

install zsh, install fzf:

Debian:

```
apt install -y zsh fzf
```

OSX:

```
brew install fzf
see: https://brew.sh

zsh is the default shell already in newer OSX
```

Run install script:

```
zsh -c "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ronivay/zsh/master/install.sh)"
```

## Uninstall ##

Remove ~/.config/zsh directory and related lines from ~/.zshrc
